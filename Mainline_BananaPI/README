This directory contains binary bundles to create a workable bootstrap system for BananaPI with mainline kernel and almost recent (at the time of writing) stage3

Notez bien : No password for root : Set one !

File systems :

- boot partition on SD's p1
- system on SD's p2

An hard disk as sda, 
- swap as sda1
- ext? (what you prefer) on sd2 that will be mounted as /mnt/sata

At system boot, following FS will be mounted :
- /mnt/sata/var2 -> /var
- /mnt/sata/home -> /home
- /mnt/sata/portage -> /usr/portage
- /mnt/sata/src -> /usr/src

/tmp and /var/tmp as tmpfs

The goal with to have a system without writing to it's SD (but system update)

Notez-bien : avoid direct root login or 'su -' to avoid root's history writing as well
